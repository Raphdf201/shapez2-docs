# Setup

# 1.1 : Modding environment

First, setup the shapez shifter API ([official instructions](https://tobspr-games.notion.site/shapez2-modding-documentation#2583c9e752e080728e40eae35a163fce)).
Make sure that the `SPZ2_SHIFTER` environment variable is set properly by doing `echo %SPZ2_SHIFTER%` on windows, or `echo $SPZ2_SHIFTER` on linux/mac.

# 1.2 : Project

I made a simple [project generator](https://www.raphdf201.net/shapez2-generator/) to get started easily. It is very ugly but it works (if you did a better version, feel free to make a pr on the [docs repo](https://github.com/Raphdf201/shapez2-docs))
